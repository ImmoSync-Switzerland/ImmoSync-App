Our Services\nImmoSync provides a digital platform that enables communication and collaboration between landlords, tenants, service providers and other stakeholders. The platform evolves continuously and may include features such as messaging, ticketing, document management, scheduling, integrations and automated workflows or bookings.\n\nInformation made available through the Services is not intended for users in jurisdictions where access or use would violate applicable law. Users accessing from outside Switzerland are solely responsible for compliance with local laws.\n\n2. Intellectual Property Rights\nAll content, trademarks, designs, software and databases within the Services are owned by ImmoSync KLG or used under appropriate licenses and are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws worldwide.\n\nWe grant you a non‑transferable, revocable and non‑exclusive license to use the Services solely for your internal purposes.

We may reject or change usernames that infringe rights or are misleading.\n\n5. Purchases and Payments\nPayments for services or subscriptions must be made in Swiss Francs (CHF) at the displayed prices. Accepted payment methods are shown during checkout. Taxes and duties are calculated according to legal requirements.\n\nYou agree to maintain current payment information and authorize us to charge due amounts via the selected method. We may review, limit or decline orders.\n\n6. Subscriptions\nSubscriptions renew automatically at the end of each term unless cancelled in time. Cancellations can be performed via the user account and take effect at the end of the current billing period.\n\nFree trials may be changed or terminated at any time. After a trial ends the account converts to a paid subscription unless cancelled earlier.\n\n7. Software\nWe may provide software or mobile apps. Where additional license terms (EULA) apply they prevail. You may not decompile, reverse engineer or redistribute software without explicit authorization.\n\n8.

This includes in particular:\n\nCollecting or scraping data without permission\nPosting unlawful, defamatory or discriminatory content\nAttempting to bypass security features or introducing malware\nAbusing support channels, false reports or identity theft.\nIn case of violations we may take legal action, remove content or suspend accounts.\n\n9.

You are responsible that your content does not violate third‑party rights or applicable law.\n\n10.

We may remove reviews that violate these guidelines.\n\n12. Mobile Application\nWhen using our mobile apps you receive a limited, revocable license to install and use them on your devices. You may not modify, redistribute or use the app to build competing products. App marketplaces (e.g. Apple App Store, Google Play) are third parties and not responsible for support of the app.\n\n13. Third‑Party Websites and Content\nThe Services may contain links to third‑party content or websites. We accept no responsibility for their content, availability or privacy practices. Use is at your own risk and subject to the third parties' terms.\n\n14. Service Management\nWe may monitor content, restrict access, delete data or perform technical adjustments to ensure secure and proper operation of the Services. We are not obligated to monitor all activities.\n\n15. Data Protection\nProtection of your data is important to us. Information on processing of personal data is provided in our Privacy Policy which forms part of these Terms. By using the Services you consent to the described processing.\n\n16. Copyright Infringements\nIf you believe content distributed via the Services infringes your copyright, contact us promptly with sufficient details to investigate.

We reserve the right to correct such errors and update content at any time.\n\n22. Disclaimer\nThe Services are provided \"as is\" and \"as available\". To the extent permitted by law we make no warranties regarding availability, error‑free operation or fitness for a particular purpose. Use is at your own risk.\n\n23. Limitation of Liability\nWe are liable only for damages caused intentionally or by gross negligence and for injury to life, body or health. For slight negligence we are liable only for breach of essential contractual obligations (cardinal duties) and limited to the typical foreseeable damage. Statutory mandatory liability remains unaffected.\n\n24. Indemnification\nYou agree to indemnify us against third‑party claims arising from your use of the Services, your content or violations of these Terms, including reasonable legal defense costs. We will inform you of such claims and coordinate the response with you.\n\n25. User Data\nYou are responsible for backing up data you upload. While we perform regular backups we do not guarantee against data loss or restoration except where caused by our gross negligence.\n\n26. Electronic Communications\nCommunication via email, in‑app messages or forms constitutes written notice. You consent to receiving electronic communications and waive paper delivery where legally permissible.\n\n27. SMS Notifications\nIf you enable SMS services (e.g. two‑factor authentication) you will receive technical messages on your mobile device. Standard carrier rates may apply. Deactivation may limit security or certain features.\n\n28. Final Provisions\nThese Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us. If any provision is invalid the remaining provisions remain effective. Rights and obligations may not be assigned without our consent. Failure to enforce a right does not constitute a waiver for the future.\n\n29.
