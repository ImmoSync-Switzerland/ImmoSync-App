Third‑Party Websites and Content\nThe Services may contain links to third‑party content or websites. We accept no responsibility for their content, availability or privacy practices. Use is at your own risk and subject to the third parties\' terms.\n\n14. Service Management\nWe may monitor content, restrict access, delete data or perform technical adjustments to ensure secure and proper operation of the Services.

For slight negligence we are liable only for breach of essential contractual obligations (cardinal duties) and limited to the typical foreseeable damage. Statutory mandatory liability remains unaffected.\n\n24. Indemnification\nYou agree to indemnify us against third‑party claims arising from your use of the Services, your content or violations of these Terms, including reasonable legal defense costs. We will inform you of such claims and coordinate the response with you.\n\n25. User Data\nYou are responsible for backing up data you upload. While we perform regular backups we do not guarantee against data loss or restoration except where caused by our gross negligence.\n\n26. Electronic Communications\nCommunication via email, in‑app messages or forms constitutes written notice. You consent to receiving electronic communications and waive paper delivery where legally permissible.\n\n27. SMS Notifications\nIf you enable SMS services (e.g. two‑factor authentication) you will receive technical messages on your mobile device. Standard carrier rates may apply. Deactivation may limit security or certain features.\n\n28. Final Provisions\nThese Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us. If any provision is invalid the remaining provisions remain effective. Rights and obligations may not be assigned without our consent. Failure to enforce a right does not constitute a waiver for the future.\n\n29.
